Thus, I gave up to set up development environment on **MacOS** directly and attempted to create a **Ubuntu**
development environment, as same as previous **Ubuntu** development environment, on my Macbook. 

Using **Docker** to set up an **Ubuntu** development environment on a **Mac** has several advantages compared to setting up the environment directly on the **Mac**:

- 1. **Consistency**: Ensures the development environment is consistent across different systems.
- 2. **Isolation**: Keeps the development environment isolated from the host system, preventing potential conflicts.
- 3. **Portability**: Easily share the environment with others by sharing the Docker image or container.
- 4. **Reproducibility**: Quickly reproduce the environment on any machine with Docker installed.
- 5. **Ease of Cleanup**: Easily remove or reset the development environment without affecting the host system.


## Install Docker

Install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), drag and drop it in `Applications`.

Check if **Docker** could work well.

```bash
docker -v
Docker version 27.0.3, build 7d4bcd8
```

## Create Dockerfile for Ubuntu Development Environment

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 

I make a Dockerfile with the commands to build an images with development environment as same as my previous **Ubuntu**.

```docker
# Use the latest Ubuntu image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Update and install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl git

# Install Bun
RUN curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To build a docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ubuntu_on_mac .
```

Then run docker image to create an container.

```bash
docker run -itd -p 3000:3000 -v $HOME/ubuntu:/home --name ubuntu ubuntu_on_mac
```
