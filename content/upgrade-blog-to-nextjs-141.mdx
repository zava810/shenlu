i have not update my blog for almost 8 mouths from may 2023. next.js has already been upgraded to the verion of 14.1.0
so it is a time to start upgrading my blog to the latest version of next.js.

## upgrAde from 13.4 to 14.1

- 1. switch pages router to App router
- 2. use metadata Api to define metadata, such as `meta` and `link` tags inside your Html `head` element for improved seo and web shareability.
- 3. create an `opengraph-image` or `twitter-image` route to generate a route segment's shared image
- 4. switch prisma orm to serverless kv with redis Api powered by [upstash](https://upstash.com/)
- 5. replace `heroicons` with `react-icons`

## conclusion

i am very satisfied with the Next.js v14.1 design philosophy, especially in metadata Api and open graph image generation.
However, [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) was not maintained for a long time. i was trying to find another way to substitute it.
